# TDD: Red-Green-Refactor

Follow the TDD cycle for every code change. Run `make test` at each step from the `api.odds-worklog/` directory.

## 1. Red -- Write a failing test

- Write a test that describes the desired behavior.
- Run `make test` and confirm the new test **fails**.
- Do not write production code yet.

## 2. Green -- Make it pass

- Write the **minimum** production code to make the failing test pass.
- Run `make test` and confirm **all** tests pass.

## 3. Refactor -- Clean up

- Improve the code (remove duplication, rename, simplify) without changing behavior.
- Run `make test` and confirm all tests **still pass**.

Repeat the cycle for each incremental change.
